1.1 Objective

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional, user-interactive snake game that:

1. Enhances programming skills in Java.

2. Demonstrates game development using the AWT and Swing libraries.

3. Implements object-oriented programming for game state and logic.

1.2 Overview

The Snake Game involves navigating a snake to eat randomly placed food while

avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The playerâ€™s score increases as

the snake eats food, and the game ends when a collision occurs.

Key features of the game include:

1. Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows with each food item consumed.

2. Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys for directional movement.

3.

1.3 Java Programming Concepts

This project uses several Java concepts:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes like Snake, Food,

and GameBoard encapsulate different functionalities.

2. AWT/Swing Libraries: To build graphical components and render the game.

3. Event Handling: To capture and process keyboard inputs for movement.

4. Multithreading: To manage the game loop for smooth rendering and real-time

updates.

5. Collections Framework: To store the snake's body segments and manage

dynamic update
